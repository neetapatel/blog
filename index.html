    <h1>writing :(</h1>
    <h3>10 feb 2022</h3>
    <p>there is <i>nothing</i> i procrastinate on anymore quite as severly as i procratinate on writing. writing is AWFUL. the process is painful, start to full stop. i'm out of practice (not that i was ever in). it's like thinking in longform requires a totally different frame of mind then everything else i do, and for once i do not have the patience to endure the process. i am frozen at the keyboard in fear of everything i will bungle with my words, even though the only people reading this paper will be me, my very supportive teacher, and my one anglophile friend. help! do you have any tips or tricks i can use to get over this stupid resistance to writing? honestly, i only need to work on 1000 words — nothing!!</p>
    <p>anyway, today in the printshop we were learning and demo-ing the screenprinting process, which begins with everyone reclaiming a used screen and cleaning it with chemicals, brushes and pressurized hoses in the wash-up room in order to remove all evidence of previously exposed liquid photo emulsion. once this is done, you can apply a fresh, thin coat of emulsion and expose it against a film containing your art work. anyway, i bring all this up mostly to say, cleaning off someone else's semesters-old calcified photo emulsion is hard, wet, manual work, and i was in the wash-up room for a while feeling extraordinarily satisfied that i could finally apply my dishwashing prowess to my practice. </p>

    <h1>glaze spectrum</h1>
    <h3>09 feb 2022</h3>
    <p>the other night, i was searching for a digital design archive whose name i had forgotten, when i stumbled across <a href="https://www.glazespectrum.com/" target="_blank">this awesome website</a>, a digital archive of ceramic glaze test tiles. i was just immediately taken by some obvious things: the overwhleming array of color, the tiling, the materiality on screen, and the ease of use of the site overall. i love how you can zoom in and see the details of each tile as well — feels a little archaeological.</p>
    <p>the website reminded me of this work from the 2015 venice biennale that i will never forgot: global earth rubbings by dutch artist herman de vries.</p>
    <img src="img/herman-de-vries.JPG" alt="installation view of 'to be all ways to be' by artist herman de vries at the 2015 venice biennale.">
    <p>i've been thinking a lot about websites lately (obviously). thanks to software / interactive class this semester, i've had a chance to re-read <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/" target="_blank">an encouraging website manifesto</a> by laurel schwulst, titled "my website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. what could yours be?" laurel makes a strong case for artists in particular to have personal websites, not merely as static archives of work, but as a space that can complement an existing practice. in her own words:</p> 
    
    <p><i>my favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. in other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. there are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. what kind of room is a website? or is a website more like a house? a boat? a cloud? a garden? a puddle? whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.</i></p>

    <p>(i was luckly enough to take laurel's <a href="https://fruitful.school/" target="_blank">fruitful.school</a> web publishing course before the pandemic hit. <a href="http://www.toactivelyproducesilence.com/" target="_blank">here's</a> what i made.)</p>

    <h1>words matter</h1>
    <h3>05 feb 2022</h3>
    <p>today, a couple of friends pointed me to <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/GENDER-LANGUAGE/LGBT/mopanqoelva/" target="_blank">this brilliantly constructed piece</a> by minami funakoshi, about gender in languages across the globe. you should read it.</p>
    <p>this past week in software class, we suggested and discussed a few tropes of web design today. one of those was the use of parallax, that effect on websites when the 'foreground' scrolls at a different rate than the 'background,' creating a sense of perspective. you see this commonly on <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/" target="_blank">apple's website</a>, for example. (although, now that i look more closely, maybe whatever apple is doing in this example is a bit more complex than parallax? not sure.) anyway, in that conversation, a point was made that parallax is overused on the internet these days, to the point of meaninglessness. but, in instances when parallax is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/07/arts/design/hokusai-fuji.html" target="_blank">used with intention</a>, that subtle motion and introduction of time within the interface can be super effective.
    <p>'gender & language,' aside from being something you should read because of its content, strikes me as another really nice use of parallax. funakoshi and the entire team behind this clearly invested a lot of time, energy, and intelligence in the project. i like how the site's design respects and elevates that dedication by feeding content to the reader slowly and more intentionally than if it were presented as one long text. the act of scrolling allows for a slight mental pause as the story builds point by point. i also enjoyed the moments where the background is employed to convey multiple phrases, or multiple voices, building up.</p>
    <p>reading this article about the gendered nature of so many languages, and attempting to write about its design, i'm left thinking about the implicitly gendered worldview of visual language, as well. more to uncover here.</p>

    <h1>happy friday!!</h1>   

    <h3>04 feb 2022</h3>

    <p>at risk of this blog becoming a chronicle of all my unsuccesful journeys around new haven of late, i'd like to start off by saying that i've just returned from an unsuccesful trip to <a href="https://bsbc.co/" target="_blank">bradley street bike co-op</a> (henceforth bsbc). if you're reading this from new haven, and you like bikes, or want a bike, or need a bike, you should come on down!! bsbc is doing amazing things in the community here, and they've grown so much over the last year. desperately want to be a regular member — must get myself over there next time they have a wtf (women trans femme) volunteer night!! more on that another time.</p> 

    <p>it might be interesting to attempt collecting the states of this site as i style it and build it moving forward. for now, a screenshot of the last state will do, while i carry on with styling this one:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="states/2022-02-04.png" alt="screenshot of the vanilla state of this blog website on 04 february 2022.">

    <p>first thing's first — definitely need to reduce the measure. maybe add some <a href="https://neeta.works/all-the-default-css-colors/" target="_blank">basic color</a> and organization while i'm at it. my tendency when typesetting is to left-align elements, but i want to try centering these blocks for a change. oh, and before anything else, i want to <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target="_blank">reset all styles</a>. i recently discovered <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">normalize.css</a> as a popular reset option, but i'm a bit intimidated to use it before really understanding everything that it does to browser defaults.</p>

    <h1>hello, world!!</h1>

    <h3>01 feb 2022</h3>

    <p>wow, everyone, such positive responses to this blog — THANK YOU!! i even got a couple of content requests, which is just thrilling. one of you asked me what my new blog is about — excellent question — and honestly i don't know! i'll figure it out as i go, and the audience of maybe six here keeps the attendant pressure rather low.</p>

    <p>today in <a href="http://www.2022.software-for-people.net/" target="_blank">software class</a> we shared the results of <a href="http://neeta.works/art369-interactive/exercises/variations-on-a-song/song1.html" target="_blank">a quick exercise on typesetting lyrics</a> in the browser using html only. amazing what people came up with!! <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/deprecated-html-tags.html" target="_blank">deprecated html tags</a> have a couple of wonderfully quirky capabilities . . .</p> 

    <marquee>for instance, the <code>&#60;marquee&#62;</code> element lol</marquee>

    <p>has anyone used the <code>&#60;portal&#62;</code> element? stumbled across it the other day <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/portal" target="_blank">on mdn docs</a> and was wondering about its application . . .</p>

    <p>one of those content requests i mentioned was for an inquiry into the graphic language of international snack packaging, which honestly i stopped working on once the pandemic hit — but maybe now is the time to bring it back!! i'm still curious. would you be interested? i have these amazing hi-res images i made on <i>the new yorker</i>'s art department scanner of various snack packages. i think i even started to sketch out a web interface to 'display' the full catalog.</p>

    <h1>my first post</h1>

    <h3>31 jan 2022</h3> 

    <p>this evening, i was walking home from a very unsuccessful trip to <a href="https://neverendingbooks.net/" target="_blank">neverending books</a> and <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanmi-oriental-food-and-gift-shop-new-haven?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)" target="_blank">my favorite kimchi maker</a>, when suddenly i felt as though i have been yearning for <i>years</i> to have a blog and now is the time to start. there have been failed attempts in the past that have taken various forms, but this one is going to be different. it's going to be a BLOG. i'm talking an old-school, 1990s-style, web 1.0 blog. a place on the web, a link among infinite links, where i can write anything, free from any pressure to perform intelligence or wit or beauty. my thoughts, on my own turf (how american).</p>


    <p>something today planted this seed in me, i think, and that was sitting here on the couch for two hours reading and annotating <a href="https://jockkinneirlibrary.org/assets/media/Lund-Ole.-2003.-The-public-debate-on-Jock-Kinneir%E2%80%99s-road-sign-alphabet.-Typography-Papers.-5.-103%E2%80%93126.pdf" target="_blank">a paper on the typographic history of britain's road signs</a>. what a wonderful winter afternoon! i sat there afterwards thinking how amazing it would be to make this a regular habit, reading all the world's academic writing on typography from this couch on monday afternoons. i also sat there thinking about how all these people publishing research on graphic design are in conversation through these papers, sharing links to ideas through the references and footnotes and reaching out to each other in this way.</p>

    <p>i'm interested in putting my thoughts out here in the public. collecting the ideas i am thinking about and interested in, and exploring them. in creating my blog, i am thinking a lot about my brilliant friends who i would love to be in conversation with, and how this website with zero interactivity is not exactly a place that encourages dialogue. yet. (that said, i will be <i>floored</i> if any of my friends actually visit this site more than once. anyway, luckily, we have other ways of communicating that are not beholden to this static interface.)</p>

    <p>from a technical and design perspective, i'm interested in building out this website, slowly, over time, and deliberately deciding which features and styles this thing needs or benefits from. i feel liberated to start from nothing, to not be weighed down by the baggage of pre-assembled template vendors.</p>

    <p>am i a blogger now?</p>
