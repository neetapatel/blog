<h1>my first post</h1>

<h3>31 jan 2022</h3> 

<p>this evening, i was walking home from a very unsuccessful trip to <a href="https://neverendingbooks.net/" target="_blank">neverending books</a> and <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanmi-oriental-food-and-gift-shop-new-haven?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)" target="_blank">my favorite kimchi maker</a>, when suddenly i felt as though i have been yearning for <i>years</i> to have a blog and now is the time to start. there have been failed attempts in the past that have taken various forms, but this one is going to be different. it's going to be a BLOG. i'm talking an old-school, 1990s-style, web 1.0 blog. a place on the web, a link among infinite links, where i can write anything, free from any pressure to perform intelligence or wit or beauty. my thoughts, on my own turf (how american).</p>


<p>something today planted this seed in me, i think, and that was sitting here on the couch for two hours reading and annotating <a href="https://jockkinneirlibrary.org/assets/media/Lund-Ole.-2003.-The-public-debate-on-Jock-Kinneir%E2%80%99s-road-sign-alphabet.-Typography-Papers.-5.-103%E2%80%93126.pdf" target="_blank">a paper on the typographic history of britain's road signs</a>. what a wonderful winter afternoon! i sat there afterwards thinking how amazing it would be to make this a regular habit, reading all the world's academic writing on typography from this couch on monday afternoons. i also sat there thinking about how all these people publishing research on graphic design are in conversation through these papers, sharing links to ideas through the references and footnotes and reaching out to each other in this way.</p>

<p>i'm interested in putting my thoughts out here in the public. collecting the ideas i am thinking about and interested in, and exploring them. in creating my blog, i am thinking a lot about my brilliant friends who i would love to be in conversation with, and how this website with zero interactivity is not exactly a place that encourgaes dialogue. yet. (that said, i will be <i>floored</i> if any of my friends actually visit this site more than once. anyway, luckily, we have other ways of communicating that are not beholden to this static interface.)</p>

<p>from a technical and design perspective, i'm interested in building out this website, slowly, over time, and deliberately deciding which features and styles this thing needs or benefits from. i feel liberated to start from nothing, to not be weighed down by the baggage of pre-assembled template vendors.</p>

<p>am i a blogger now?</p>
